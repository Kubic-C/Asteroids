# Asteroids
A fun little multiplayer game that uses ECS to handle main game data. The code is sort of a mess but is mostly readable. 
This game is simply a playground for me to test different software architectures and designs. 

## Building
It is built using CMake, the most tested platform is Windows 10+. I have not built on Linux systems in a while, so if it
doesn't compile, sorry ;p
